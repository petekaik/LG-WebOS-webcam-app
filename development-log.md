# Development Log

This document serves as a record of all development activities, key decisions, errors encountered, and their solutions for the LG-WebOS-webcam-app. It is essential to keep this document updated at all times to ensure transparency and traceability in the development process.

## 18 April 2025

### Key Decisions
- **Clean Environment Setup**: Removed all old development files except for `README.md`, `requirements-specification.md`, and files part of the initial Ares setup.
- **Documentation Update**: Added `development-log.md` to track all future development activities.
- **Initial Implementation**: Created the basic structure of the webcam viewer app with the following features:
  - Grid layout for multiple webcam feeds
  - Full-screen mode with navigation
  - Clock display using WebOS API
  - Error logging functionality
  - 5-way navigation support

### Implementation Details
- Used CSS Grid for the webcam layout with a 2x2 grid design
- Implemented navigation with remote control arrow keys
- Added visual focus indicator for the selected webcam
- Created error handling for unavailable webcam feeds
- Implemented the clock using the WebOS system service API

### Errors & Solutions
- **No errors encountered during implementation.**

### Next Steps
- Test the application on actual WebOS device
- Implement configuration UI for dynamic webcam setup
- Add support for different layout options (3x3, 2x3, etc.)
- Add audio support for full-screen mode

## 18 April 2025 (Afternoon)

### Key Decisions
- **Real Stream Integration**: Updated webcam configuration with actual HLS stream URLs:
  - Etupiha: http://192.168.1.20:8888/etupiha/index.m3u8
  - Takapiha: http://192.168.1.20:8888/takapiha/index.m3u8
- **Native Video Playback**: Chose to rely on the WebOS TV's native HLS streaming capabilities instead of using external libraries
- **Enhanced Video Experience**: Implemented proper video handling features:
  - Muted audio in grid view (per FR-1.3)
  - Enabled audio in full-screen mode (per FR-1.4)
  - Added robust error handling for stream issues

### Implementation Details
- Used HTML5 video elements with native HLS support
- Implemented comprehensive error handling for video streams
- Added visual error indicators when streams are unavailable
- Improved logging with both on-screen messages and console output
- Optimized video playback for WebOS environment

### Technical Considerations
- WebOS TVs have built-in support for HLS streaming, eliminating the need for external libraries
- Simplified implementation follows the design principle of minimizing dependencies
- Better performance by using native capabilities instead of JavaScript libraries
- Reduced memory footprint and potential compatibility issues

### Next Steps
- Test streams on actual WebOS device to validate native HLS playback
- Create a configuration interface for adding/editing camera streams
- Implement a reconnection mechanism for temporarily unavailable streams
- Add support for more stream formats if needed (RTSP, MJPEG, etc.)

### Key Decisions
- **Improved User Experience**: Added splash screen and enhanced placeholder text for failed streams
- **Build and Deploy Process**: Created a helper shell script for automating the packaging and deployment of the app

### Implementation Details
- **Splash Screen**:
  - Added an animated loading screen that appears when the app starts
  - Included a spinner animation to indicate loading process
  - Display current activity (e.g., "Loading Etupiha feed...")
  - Auto-hides when app is ready or after a timeout
  
- **Enhanced Placeholder Text**:
  - Replaced simple error messages with friendly, informative placeholders
  - Added camera icons and detailed messages for unavailable streams
  - Consistent styling between grid view and fullscreen mode
  - Clear instructions for users about potential troubleshooting steps

- **Stream Load Management**:
  - Improved handling of stream loading states
  - Added logic to track successful and failed stream loads
  - Optimized splash screen dismissal based on loading status
  - Enhanced error reporting and recovery

### Testing Results
- App successfully built and deployed to TV using the build_and_install.sh script
- Splash screen displays correctly during the initial loading
- Placeholder messages show properly when streams are unavailable
- Navigation and user interface work as expected

### Next Steps
- build_and_install.sh functionality enhancement: Get app info from appinfo.json and build .ipk with correct metadata (version info, package name, etc.)
- build_and_install.sh functionality enhancement: Move created .ipk to /build directory after successful build and install to TV
- Add network status information
- Add stream reconnection functionality

## 19 April 2025

### Key Decisions
- **Enhanced Build Process**: Improved the build_and_install.sh script for better app packaging and deployment workflow

### Implementation Details
- **Build Script Enhancements**:
  - Added proper JSON parsing of appinfo.json to extract all relevant app metadata
  - Implemented fallback mechanisms to handle environments without jq (using grep/cut)
  - Created a dedicated build directory structure to organize output files
  - Added functionality to automatically move IPK package files to the build directory
  - Improved error handling and reporting during the build and installation process
  - Enhanced command-line output with better formatting and more detailed information

### Technical Considerations
- The improved build script provides a more robust and maintainable deployment process
- Organizing build artifacts in a dedicated directory improves project cleanliness
- Better extraction of app metadata ensures consistency across the build process
- Detailed error messages and status updates make troubleshooting easier

### Next Steps
- Implement network connectivity monitoring in the application
- Add grid view layout options in the settings menu
- Add stream reconnection functionality for improved reliability
- Test the enhanced build script with various deployment scenarios
