# Requirements Specification

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed requirements and user stories for the LG-WebOS-webcam-app. The app is designed to display webcam video feeds on LG WebOS TVs, specifically optimized for the LG OLED65C8 model. The requirements are structured to align with agile software development practices.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Webcam Feed Display
- **FR-1.1**: **As a user, I want to view multiple webcam feeds in a grid layout** so that I can monitor all cameras at once.
- **FR-1.2**: **As a user, I want to select a specific webcam feed** to view it in full-screen mode.
- **FR-1.3**: **As a user, I want the video feeds to be muted in the grid view** to avoid overlapping audio.
- **FR-1.4**: **As a user, I want the video feed to play with audio in full-screen mode** for better monitoring.

### 2. Navigation
- **FR-2.1**: **As a user, I want to navigate between video feeds using the remote control's arrow keys** so that I can easily select a camera.
- **FR-2.2**: **As a user, I want to return to the grid view from full-screen mode** by pressing the back button on the remote.
- **FR-2.3**: **As a user, I want to switch between cameras in full-screen mode using the up and down arrow keys** for quick access.

### 3. Clock Integration
- **FR-3.1**: **As a user, I want to see the current time displayed on the screen** so that I can keep track of time while monitoring.

### 4. Error Logging
- **FR-4.1**: **As a user, I want to see error messages in a log box** so that I am aware of any issues with the video feeds.
- **FR-4.2**: **As a user, I want the log box to disappear automatically after a few seconds** to avoid cluttering the screen.

### 5. Configuration
- **FR-5.1**: **As a developer, I want to configure the webcam feeds dynamically** so that the app can support different camera setups.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance
- **NFR-1.1**: The app should load and display video feeds within 2 seconds.
- **NFR-1.2**: The app should support at least 4 simultaneous video feeds without performance degradation.

### 2. Compatibility
- **NFR-2.1**: The app must be compatible with WebOS 3.0 and above.
- **NFR-2.2**: The app must work seamlessly on LG OLED65C8 TVs.

### 3. Usability
- **NFR-3.1**: The app should be intuitive to use with minimal instructions.
- **NFR-3.2**: The app should support both pointer and 5-way navigation modes.

### 4. Maintainability
- **NFR-4.1**: The app should be built using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to minimize complexity.
- **NFR-4.2**: The app should avoid dependencies on Node.js or other build tools.

## User Stories

### User Story 1: Viewing Webcam Feeds
- **US-1.1**: **As a user, I want to see all available webcam feeds in a grid layout,** so that I can monitor multiple locations at once.

### User Story 2: Full-Screen Mode
- **US-2.1**: **As a user, I want to select a webcam feed to view it in full-screen mode,** so that I can focus on a specific location.

### User Story 3: Navigation
- **US-3.1**: **As a user, I want to navigate between video feeds using the remote control,** so that I can easily switch cameras.

### User Story 4: Error Handling
- **US-4.1**: **As a user, I want to see error messages in a log box,** so that I am aware of any issues with the video feeds.

### User Story 5: Clock Display
- **US-5.1**: **As a user, I want to see the current time displayed on the screen,** so that I can keep track of time while monitoring.

### User Story 6: Dynamic Configuration
- **US-6.1**: **As a developer, I want to configure the webcam feeds dynamically,** so that the app can support different camera setups.

## Future Enhancements
- **FE-1**: **Motion Detection**: Add support for motion detection to alert users of activity.
- **FE-2**: **Recording**: Enable recording of video feeds for later review.
- **FE-3**: **Custom Layouts**: Allow users to customize the grid layout of video feeds.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **AC-1**: The app must display video feeds in a grid layout with proper styling.
- **AC-2**: The app must allow users to switch between grid and full-screen modes.
- **AC-3**: The app must handle errors gracefully and display messages in the log box.
- **AC-4**: The app must display the current time on the screen.
- **AC-5**: The app must support navigation using both pointer and 5-way modes.

## Glossary
- **Grid View**: A layout where multiple video feeds are displayed simultaneously.
- **Full-Screen Mode**: A mode where a single video feed occupies the entire screen.
- **5-Way Navigation**: Navigation using the up, down, left, right, and enter keys on a remote control.
