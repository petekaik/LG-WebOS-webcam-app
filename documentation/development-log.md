# Development Log

This document serves as a record of all development activities, key decisions, errors encountered, and their solutions for the LG-WebOS-webcam-app. It is essential to keep this document updated at all times to ensure transparency and traceability in the development process.

## 18 April 2025

### Key Decisions
- **Clean Environment Setup**: Removed all old development files except for `README.md`, `requirements-specification.md`, and files part of the initial Ares setup.
- **Documentation Update**: Added `development-log.md` to track all future development activities.
- **Initial Implementation**: Created the basic structure of the webcam viewer app with the following features:
  - Grid layout for multiple webcam feeds
  - Full-screen mode with navigation
  - Clock display using WebOS API
  - Error logging functionality
  - 5-way navigation support

### Implementation Details
- Used CSS Grid for the webcam layout with a 2x2 grid design
- Implemented navigation with remote control arrow keys
- Added visual focus indicator for the selected webcam
- Created error handling for unavailable webcam feeds
- Implemented the clock using the WebOS system service API

### Errors & Solutions
- **No errors encountered during implementation.**

### Next Steps
- Test the application on actual WebOS device
- Implement configuration UI for dynamic webcam setup
- Add support for different layout options (3x3, 2x3, etc.)
- Add audio support for full-screen mode

## 18 April 2025 (Afternoon)

### Key Decisions
- **Real Stream Integration**: Updated webcam configuration with actual HLS stream URLs:
  - Etupiha: http://192.168.1.20:8888/etupiha/index.m3u8
  - Takapiha: http://192.168.1.20:8888/takapiha/index.m3u8
- **Native Video Playback**: Chose to rely on the WebOS TV's native HLS streaming capabilities instead of using external libraries
- **Enhanced Video Experience**: Implemented proper video handling features:
  - Muted audio in grid view (per FR-1.3)
  - Enabled audio in full-screen mode (per FR-1.4)
  - Added robust error handling for stream issues

### Implementation Details
- Used HTML5 video elements with native HLS support
- Implemented comprehensive error handling for video streams
- Added visual error indicators when streams are unavailable
- Improved logging with both on-screen messages and console output
- Optimized video playback for WebOS environment

### Technical Considerations
- WebOS TVs have built-in support for HLS streaming, eliminating the need for external libraries
- Simplified implementation follows the design principle of minimizing dependencies
- Better performance by using native capabilities instead of JavaScript libraries
- Reduced memory footprint and potential compatibility issues

### Next Steps
- Test streams on actual WebOS device to validate native HLS playback
- Create a configuration interface for adding/editing camera streams
- Implement a reconnection mechanism for temporarily unavailable streams
- Add support for more stream formats if needed (RTSP, MJPEG, etc.)

### Implementation Details
- **Splash Screen**:
  - Added an animated loading screen that appears when the app starts
  - Included a spinner animation to indicate loading process
  - Display current activity (e.g., "Loading Etupiha feed...")
  - Auto-hides when app is ready or after a timeout
  
- **Enhanced Placeholder Text**:
  - Replaced simple error messages with friendly, informative placeholders
  - Added camera icons and detailed messages for unavailable streams
  - Consistent styling between grid view and fullscreen mode
  - Clear instructions for users about potential troubleshooting steps

- **Stream Load Management**:
  - Improved handling of stream loading states
  - Added logic to track successful and failed stream loads
  - Optimized splash screen dismissal based on loading status
  - Enhanced error reporting and recovery

### Testing Results
- App successfully built and deployed to TV using the build_and_install.sh script
- Splash screen displays correctly during the initial loading
- Placeholder messages show properly when streams are unavailable
- Navigation and user interface work as expected

### Next Steps
- build_and_install.sh functionality enhancement: Get app info from appinfo.json and build .ipk with correct metadata (version info, package name, etc.)
- build_and_install.sh functionality enhancement: Move created .ipk to /build directory after successful build and install to TV
- Add network status information
- Add stream reconnection functionality

## 19 April 2025

### Key Decisions

### Key Decisions
- **Settings UI Bug Fixes**: Fixed multiple issues with the Settings menu functionality to ensure proper operation in the WebOS TV environment

### Implementation Details
- **Fixed Blank Settings Dialog Issue**:
  - Corrected the structure of settings menu content to ensure proper display in WebOS
  - Fixed mode switching functionality so the correct content is displayed when opening different settings sections
  - Ensured settings content is properly connected to the settings overlay

- **Add/Edit/Delete Webcam Functionality**:
  - Implemented full functionality for adding new webcam streams
  - Fixed edit mode to properly display and save changes to existing webcams
  - Created custom confirmation dialog for delete operations since WebOS doesn't handle native browser confirm() dialogs well

- **Grid Layout Settings Fixes**:
  - Simplified grid layout options to just "Auto (Dynamic)" and "Custom Grid" for better usability
  - Fixed issue where grid layout settings weren't properly persisted in localStorage
  - Implemented proper display of saved grid layout settings when reopening the settings menu
  - Fixed selection persistence issue by completely recreating the select element instead of trying to modify its value

- **WebOS-Specific Adaptations**:
  - Replaced standard DOM operations that don't work well in WebOS with more robust alternatives
  - Added explicit selection setting for dropdowns since standard value setting wasn't reliable
  - Implemented forced redraw mechanisms to ensure the UI updates properly after changes
  - Added extensive debug logging to track down WebOS-specific rendering issues

- **Webcam Display Logic**:
  - Fixed issue where disabled webcams were still being displayed in the grid view
  - Implemented filtering to only show enabled webcams in the grid
  - Added proper handling for cases where no webcams are enabled

### Technical Considerations
- WebOS TV has limited browser capabilities compared to desktop browsers, requiring special handling for:
  - DOM manipulation (especially for form elements)
  - Dialog and overlay management
  - Event handling and redrawing
  - localStorage interaction

- The fixes implemented use more direct DOM manipulation approaches that are more compatible with the WebOS TV browser environment

### Testing Results
- All settings menu options now display and function correctly
- Grid layout settings are properly saved and applied
- Add/Edit/Delete webcam functionality works as expected
- Custom confirmation dialog appears and functions correctly when deleting webcams
- Only enabled webcams are displayed in the grid view

### Next Steps
- Test on multiple WebOS TV versions to ensure cross-version compatibility
- Implement more robust error recovery for network issues
- Add visual keyboard navigation for input fields
- Consider adding presets for common webcam configurations
