# Requirements Specification

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed requirements for the LG-WebOS-webcam-app using a user story format. The app is designed to display webcam video feeds on LG WebOS TVs, specifically optimized for the LG OLED65C8 model. The requirements are structured to align with agile software development practices.

### User Interface
- **US-3.1**: As a user, I want to see the current time displayed on the screen in grid view so that I can keep track of time while monitoring.
- **US-3.2**: As a user, I want the current time to be hidden when in full screen viewing mode so that I can focus on the video content.
- **US-3.3**: As a user, I want to see error messages in a log box so that I am aware of any issues with the video feeds.
- **US-3.4**: As a user, I want the log box to disappear automatically after a few seconds to avoid cluttering the screen.

### Splash Screen
- **US-7.1**: As a user, I want to see a splash screen when the app starts so that I know the application is loading.
- **US-7.2**: As a user, I want the splash screen to display loading progress or status messages so that I understand what's happening during initialization.

- **US-7.4**: As a user, I want the splash screen to provide visual feedback if there's an initialization error so that I'm aware of any problems.

### Configuration
- **US-4.1**: As a user, I want to configure the webcam feeds dynamically so that the app can support different camera setups.
- **US-4.2**: As a user, I want the app to be intuitive to use with minimal instructions.
- **US-4.3**: As a user, I want the app to support both pointer and 5-way navigation modes.
- **US-4.4**: As a user, I want the app to support connections to cameras using self-signed SSL certificates so that I can use my existing home security cameras without certificate errors.

### Settings Menu - Webcam Management
- **US-5.1**: As a user, I want to access a settings menu to add new webcam feeds by providing a name, URL, and optional snapshot URL so that I can expand my monitoring system.
- **US-5.2**: As a user, I want to edit existing webcam feed configurations (name, URL, snapshot URL) so that I can update them when needed.
- **US-5.3**: As a user, I want to remove webcam feeds I no longer need to keep my interface uncluttered.
- **US-5.4**: As a user, I want to enable or disable individual webcam feeds without removing them so that I can temporarily hide certain cameras.
- **US-5.5**: As a user, I want to specify options for SSL certificate validation for each webcam so that I can connect to cameras with self-signed certificates.

### Settings Menu - Grid Layout
- **US-6.1**: As a user, I want to customize the grid layout by selecting between automatic or custom arrangements so that I can optimize the display for my needs.
- **US-6.2**: As a user, I want to specify the number of rows and columns in the grid when using custom layout so that I can create the perfect viewing arrangement.
- **US-6.3**: As a user, I want to choose whether camera labels are displayed in the grid view for better identification of feeds.
- **US-6.4**: As a user, I want to set an auto-refresh interval for static image feeds so they stay current without manual intervention.

### Settings Menu - Reset & Default Values
- **US-8.1**: As a user, I want to reset the application to its default settings when I encounter configuration issues so that I can start fresh without reinstalling.
- **US-8.2**: As a user, I want the reset option to be protected by a confirmation dialog so that I don't accidentally lose my configuration.
- **US-8.3**: As a user, I want a clear indication of what settings will be reset so that I understand the consequences of the action.
- **US-8.4**: As a user, I want the default configuration to include sample webcams that work out of the box so I can immediately test the functionality.
