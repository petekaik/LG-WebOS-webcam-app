# Enhancement Ideas
This document describes additional development ideas for the app

## Debug mode (implemented)
Implement a debug setting (off by default) which (when enabled) lets user to see mode detailed logging output (key presses, navigation, activities taken) in UI log box. Default logging level should display only errors.

## Intuitive navigation in grid view (defected)
Depending on the number of webcam feeds configured, the main grid view can contain preview images in one or more rows. Implement navigation system for left-right-up-down so that selecting between the streams is intuitive. Currently defected: Small preview images are shown initially but preview images of video streams pop out of dimensions after couple of seconds.
